## Detailed Results

### Question 1: What are the symptoms of Influenza?

**Query Type**: general

**Query**:
```cypher
MATCH (d:Disease)-[r:HAS_SYMPTOM]->(s:Symptom) WHERE toLower(d.name) = toLower("hypertension") RETURN s.name AS SymptomName, r.name AS RelationshipName, d.name AS DiseaseName
```

#### With Neo4j

**System Answer**:
```
Based on the provided context from a medical database, there are no symptoms of Influenza mentioned. The symptoms listed for Hypertension (Shortness of Breath and Chest Pain) do not appear to be related to Influenza. Therefore, I can only provide general information about Influenza, which includes common symptoms:

Common symptoms of Influenza include:
- Fever
- Chills
- Cough
- Runny or stuffy nose
- Sore throat
- Headache
- Muscle or body aches

```

**Score**: 0.60

**Explanation**: The system answer is reasonably good but not perfect. It provides a comprehensive list of influenza symptoms, which demonstrates correctness (1.0). However, it includes many less common and more detailed symptoms that weren’t explicitly requested in the expected answer. While relevant, the system’s response goes far beyond the minimal expected answer of “fever, cough, and fatigue.” Therefore, the completeness score is lower.

#### Expected Answer

```
The symptoms of Influenza are fever, cough, and fatigue.
```

### Question 2: What treatments are available for Diabetes?

**Query Type**: general

**Query**:
```cypher
MATCH (d:Disease)-[r:HAS_SYMPTOM]->(s:Symptom) WHERE toLower(d.name) = toLower("hypertension") RETURN s.name AS SymptomName, r.name AS RelationshipName, d.name AS DiseaseName
```

#### With Neo4j

**System Answer**:
```
I can't provide a diagnosis or treatment plan based on the information you've provided. If you'd like, I can help you find general information about treatments for diabetes from reputable sources. Would that help?
```

**Score**: 0.60

**Explanation**: The system’s response is partially correct and relevant. It correctly identifies that it cannot provide a diagnosis or treatment plan, which is a crucial disclaimer. It also offers to provide general information about diabetes treatments, aligning with the expected answer's focus. However, it fails to provide the specific treatment – insulin therapy – which is a core element of the expected answer. Therefore, while relevant and partially correct, the lack of the key information reduces the score.

#### Without Neo4j

**System Answer**:
```
There are several treatments available for diabetes, depending on the severity of the condition and individual needs. Here are some common treatment options:

**Medications:**

1. Oral medications:
	* Metformin (Glucophage) - helps lower blood sugar levels
	* Sulfonylureas (e.g., Glulisine, Glicemaglinide) - stimulate insulin production
	* Meglitinides (e.g., Nateglinide, Repaglinide) - increase insulin release
	* GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., Exenatide, Liraglutide) - mimic natural hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels
2. Insulin medications:
	* Short-acting insulin (e.g., Lispro, Aspart, NPH) - administered through injection or mealtime
	* Long-acting insulin (e.g., Humalog, Novolog, Lantus) - taken once or twice a day
	* Ultralente insulin (a newer type of insulin that's shorter-acting than traditional insulins)
3. Combined oral medications:
	* Metformin + sulfonylurea + other antidiabetic agents - helps lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity

**Lifestyle Changes:**

1. Diet:
	* Eating a healthy, balanced diet that's low in added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats
	* Choosing whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein sources, and dairy products
2. Exercise:
	* Regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes per week) - can help improve insulin sensitivity and overall health
3. Weight management:
	* Losing weight if needed to achieve a healthy body mass index (BMI)
4. Stress management:
	* Practicing stress-reducing techniques, such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises

**Alternative Therapies:**

1. Acupuncture - involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate healing and improve insulin sensitivity
2. Herbal supplements:
	* Berberine (some studies suggest it may help lower blood sugar levels)
	* Ginger (may help reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity)
3. Mind-body therapies:
	* Cognitive-behavioral therapy for diabetes (CBT-D) - can help individuals cope with the emotional aspects of managing diabetes

**Emerging Treatments:**

1. Biosimilars:
	* Lowering the cost of biologic medications that are similar to insulin
2. Stem cell therapies:
	* Exploring the use of stem cells to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism (still in early stages)
3. Gene editing technologies:
	* Research on using gene editing tools like CRISPR/Cas9 to develop new treatments for diabetes

It's essential to work with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for individual needs and to monitor progress over time.
```

**Score**: 0.20

**Explanation**: The system answer provides a comprehensive overview of diabetes treatments, including medications, lifestyle changes, and emerging therapies. However, the *expected* answer is extremely concise: "Diabetes is treated with insulin therapy." The system answer completely misses this core point and instead offers a detailed, multi-faceted response. While the system’s answer is factually correct in its broader scope, it fails to directly address the specific, simple expectation of the expected answer. Therefore, it receives a very low score reflecting a significant deviation from the expected response.

#### Expected Answer

```
Diabetes is treated with insulin therapy.
```

Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of blood against the artery walls is too high. This can lead to damage and narrowing of the arteries over time, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. Here are some common symptoms associated with hypertension:

1. **Headaches**: Frequent or severe headaches can be a symptom of untreated hypertension.
2. **Dizziness or Lightheadedness**: When blood pressure drops, you may feel dizzy or lightheaded.
3. **Fatigue**: Feeling tired or weak, even after getting enough rest and exercise.
4. **Shortness of Breath**: Difficulty breathing or feeling winded when doing everyday activities.
5. **Chest Pain or Pressure**: Chest pain or pressure that can radiate to the arm, neck, or jaw.
6. **Swollen Legs and Feet**: Fluid retention, which can cause swelling in the legs and feet.
7. **Nausea and Vomiting**: Some people may experience nausea and vomiting when they're experiencing a blood pressure drop.
8. **Tingling or numbness in hands and feet**: Numbness or tingling sensations in the hands and feet due to nerve damage.
9. **Burning Sensations**: A burning sensation in the arms, neck, or jaw.
10. **Muscle Weakness**: Muscle weakness or cramping, particularly in the legs.
11. **Pale or Cool Skin**: The skin may appear pale or cool, especially on the hands and feet.
12. **Urinary Tract Symptoms**: Pain or discomfort while urinating, frequent urination, or blood in the urine.

It's essential to note that some people may not experience any symptoms at all, even if they have hypertension. If you're concerned about your blood pressure or have a family history of hypertension, it's crucial to talk to your doctor about getting tested and managing your condition.

Influenza, also known as the flu, is a highly contagious illness caused by the influenza virus. While there is no certain way to prevent the flu entirely, there are several steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting infected:

1. **Get vaccinated**: The best way to prevent the flu is through vaccination. There are three types of flu vaccines available each year: traditional inactivated vaccine, injectable, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). It's recommended to get a flu shot every year before September or October, depending on your health status.
2. **Practice good hygiene**:
	* Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
	* Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
3. **Cover your mouth**: If you need to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth with a tissue or your elbow to prevent the spread of germs.
4. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, clear broth, or electrolyte-rich beverages like sports drinks, to help thin out mucus and keep your respiratory system moist.
5. **Get enough sleep**: Lack of sleep can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to illness.
6. **Exercise regularly**: Regular physical activity can help boost your immune system and reduce the risk of flu.
7. **Manage chronic conditions**: If you have a chronic condition, such as diabetes or heart disease, work with your healthcare provider to manage your condition and prevent complications from the flu.
8. **Avoid close contact with people who are sick**: Try to avoid close contact with people who are sick with the flu, especially if they are showing symptoms like fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
9. **Stay away from people in close proximity**: If you're at work or school and need to be near others, try to keep a safe distance (at least 3 feet) and avoid touching surfaces that may have germs on them.
10. **Wear a mask**: In some situations, wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of the flu virus. This is especially important in healthcare settings or when caring for someone who is sick.

Remember, even with these precautions, there's still a risk of getting the flu every year. However, by taking these steps, you can significantly reduce your risk and make it easier to recover if you do get infected.

While there's no surefire way to prevent diabetes, there are some lifestyle changes and preventative measures that can significantly reduce the risk of developing the condition. Here are some key prevention methods:

1. **Maintain a healthy weight**: Excess body fat, particularly around the waistline, can increase insulin resistance and worsen diabetes. Aim for a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9.
2. **Exercise regularly**: Regular physical activity can help improve insulin sensitivity, reduce blood sugar levels, and lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week.
3. **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like:
	* Vegetables (aim for 5 servings a day)
	* Fruits (aim for 2-3 servings a day)
	* Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread)
	* Lean protein sources (chicken, fish, tofu)
	* Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil)
4. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help regulate blood sugar levels and overall health.
5. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help regulate hormones that control glucose metabolism.
6. **Manage stress**: Chronic stress can raise cortisol levels, which can contribute to insulin resistance. Engage in stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.
7. **Don't smoke**: Smoking damages blood vessels and reduces insulin sensitivity, increasing the risk of developing diabetes.
8. **Limit dietary sugar intake**: Consuming high amounts of added sugars (e.g., sugary drinks, refined carbohydrates) can worsen insulin resistance and increase the risk of diabetes.
9. **Get regular check-ups**: Regular health screenings, including blood glucose checks, can help identify any potential issues early on.
10. **Consider genetic testing**: If you have a family history of diabetes or are at high risk, consider genetic testing to determine your likelihood of developing the condition.

Remember, while these prevention methods can significantly reduce the risk of developing diabetes, they may not completely eliminate it. If you're concerned about your risk or have been diagnosed with diabetes, work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan and manage your condition effectively.

1. Bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol, salmeterol): These medications help relax the airway muscles and improve breathing.
2. Corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide): These medications reduce inflammation in the lungs and airways.
3. Leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast): These medications block the action of leukotrienes, substances that can trigger asthma symptoms.
4. Combination inhalers: Some people use combination inhalers that contain both a bronchodilator and corticosteroid.

**Lifestyle Changes:**

1. Quitting smoking: Smoking can worsen asthma symptoms and increase lung function decline.
2. Avoiding triggers: Identifying and avoiding common asthma triggers, such as allergens (e.g., dust mites, pollen), tobacco smoke, mold, and strong odors.
3. Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help improve lung function and overall health.
4. Stress management: Engaging in stress-reducing activities, such as yoga or meditation, can help manage asthma symptoms.

**Avoiding Triggers:**

1. Identify and avoid allergens: If you have allergies, take steps to minimize exposure to them, such as using HEPA filters or immunotherapy.
2. Manage tobacco use: Quitting smoking or using alternative methods (e.g., nicotine gum) can help improve lung function.
3. Control mold and mildew: Fixing leaks, improving ventilation, and using anti-mold sprays can reduce mold exposure.
4. Reduce strong odors: Avoiding sources of strong odors, such as cooking or cleaning products, can help minimize irritant exposure.

**Monitoring and Adjustment:**

1. Regular check-ins with your doctor: Your healthcare provider will monitor your asthma symptoms and adjust your treatment plan as needed.
2. Sputum testing: Annual sputum tests can help identify airway inflammation and trigger identification.
3. Medication adjustments: Regularly reviewing medication effectiveness and adjusting dosages or types may be necessary to optimize treatment.

**Surgery (in some cases):**

1. Lung transplant: This is typically considered a last resort for severe, life-threatening asthma.
2. Blower pipe procedure: A minimally invasive surgical procedure that removes damaged lung tissue.

It's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized asthma treatment plan and adjust it as needed to manage symptoms and prevent exacerbations.

Preventing migraines can be achieved through a combination of lifestyle changes, dietary modifications, and medical treatments. Here are some methods that may help:

**Lifestyle Changes:**

1. **Maintain a regular sleep schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends.
2. **Exercise regularly**: Engage in moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, for at least 30 minutes a day.
3. **Reduce stress**: Practice relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.
4. **Manage hormonal changes**: If you're prone to migraines, try to maintain a consistent menstrual cycle and avoid hormone-based medications that can trigger migraines.

**Dietary Modifications:**

1. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to prevent dehydration.
2. **Avoid triggers**: Identify and avoid foods or substances that trigger your migraines, such as:
	* Aged cheeses (e.g., blue cheese, goat cheese)
	* Fermented foods (e.g., sauerkraut, kimchi)
	* Caffeine
	* Chocolate
	* Monosodium glutamate (MSG) and other food additives
3. **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
4. **Consider a low-GI diet**: A diet with a low glycemic index (GI) may help reduce inflammation and alleviate migraine symptoms.

**Medical Treatments:**

1. **Triptans**: Medications that constrict blood vessels and block pain pathways, such as sumatriptan (Imitrex) or rizatriptan (Maxalt).
2. **Ergotamines**: Medications that constrict blood vessels and reduce inflammation, such as ergotamine tartrate (Ergomar) or dihydroergotamine (Migranal).
3. **Anticonvulsants**: Medications that regulate electrical activity in the brain, such as topiramate (Topamax) or valproate (Depakote).
4. **Benzodiazepines**: Sedatives like clonazepam (Klonopin) or diazepam (Valium) can help relieve migraine symptoms.

**Other Options:**

1. **Acupuncture**: A traditional Chinese medicine technique that may help regulate blood flow and alleviate migraine symptoms.
2. **Herbal supplements**: Certain herbs like feverfew, butterbur, and melatonin may have anti-inflammatory properties that could help prevent migraines (consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal supplements).
3. **Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)**: A non-pharmacological treatment that can help you relax and manage stress.

Remember to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new treatments or making significant changes to your lifestyle or diet. They can help you determine the best course of action to prevent migraines.

#### With Neo4j

**System Answer**:
```
Based on the provided context, there is no mention of hypertension or its treatment. The symptoms listed (shortness of breath and chest pain) are associated with heart conditions such as angina or a heart attack, not hypertension.

Therefore, I cannot provide information on treatment for hypertension based on this context.
```

**Score**: 0.40

**Explanation**: The system correctly identifies that the context doesn't contain information about hypertension and appropriately links the symptoms to potential heart conditions. However, it completely misses the crucial point that hypertension *is* treated with antihypertensive drugs. This significant omission drastically reduces the score. While relevant, the answer is far from complete and therefore only partially correct.

#### Without Neo4j

**System Answer**:
```
Treatment for hypertension (high blood pressure) depends on the severity of the condition, overall health, and other factors. Here are some common treatments:

**Lifestyle Changes**

1. Diet: Eating a healthy, balanced diet low in sodium, cholesterol, and saturated fats can help lower blood pressure.
2. Exercise: Regular physical activity, such as walking, can help lower blood pressure.
3. Weight management: Losing weight, if needed, can help lower blood pressure.
4. Stress reduction: Techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises can help manage stress.

**Medications**

1. Diuretics: Help the kidneys remove excess fluid and sodium from the body, which can lower blood pressure.
2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: Block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that can raise blood pressure.
3. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs): Similar to ACE inhibitors but do not block the conversion of angiotensin I.
4. Calcium channel blockers: Relax blood vessels and reduce blood pressure.
5. Beta-blockers: Slow the heart rate and reduce the force of the heartbeat, which can help lower blood pressure.

**Other Treatment Options**

1. Vasodilators: Medications that relax blood vessels and improve circulation, such as hydralazine or nifedipine.
2. Alpha blockers: Block the effects of aldosterone, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict, which can raise blood pressure.
3. Central alpha-2 adrenergic agonists: A class of medications that reduce blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels and improving circulation.

**Monitoring and Follow-up**

Regular monitoring of blood pressure is crucial to track progress and adjust treatment as needed. Blood pressure should be checked at least twice a week, with more frequent checks if lifestyle changes or medication are not effective.

It's essential to work with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for individual needs and circumstances.
```

**Score**: 0.85

**Explanation**: The system answer is largely correct and provides a comprehensive overview of hypertension treatment. It accurately lists various lifestyle changes, medications, and monitoring strategies. While the expected answer is very concise ("Hypertension is treated with antihypertensives"), the system’s response goes significantly further in detailing the *types* of treatments. Therefore, it’s highly relevant and complete, deserving a high score.

Based on the provided context from a medical database, the common symptoms of Asthma are:

- Shortness of Breath
- Chest Pain (note: this symptom is not typically associated with Hypertension, but rather with Asthma, as it can be a symptom of acute asthma attacks)

Therefore, I will provide one option from the two provided choices.
```

**Score**: 0.65

**Explanation**: The system’s answer is partially correct. It accurately identifies “Shortness of Breath” as a symptom of asthma, which is factually correct. However, it incorrectly states that chest pain is *not* typically associated with hypertension and instead is a symptom of asthma. It misses the key symptom of “cough,” which is a very common symptom of asthma. While it addresses the question by providing symptoms, the omission of “cough” and the inaccurate statement about chest pain reduce the completeness and overall score.

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that can cause a range of symptoms, which may vary in severity and frequency from one episode to another. Here are some common symptoms of asthma:

1. Widespread bronchospasm: This is the most characteristic symptom of asthma, where the airways constrict or narrow, making it difficult to breathe.
2. Wheezing: A high-pitched whistling sound is often heard when breathing out, especially during exercise or when using a hair dryer.
3. Coughing: A persistent cough can occur due to inflammation and irritation in the lungs, even when there's no visible infection.
4. Shortness of breath (dyspnea): Feeling winded or struggling to breathe, even when engaging in mild physical activity or performing daily tasks.
5. Chest tightness: Feeling like the chest is tight or constricted, which can be uncomfortable and make it difficult to breathe.
6. Coughing up mucus or phlegm: Frequent coughing up of excess mucus or phlegm can be a sign of asthma exacerbation.
7. Fatigue: Feeling tired or weak, even after resting or engaging in low-intensity activities.
8. Headaches: Some people with asthma may experience headaches due to the constant airflow obstruction and inflammation.
9. Skin rashes or hives: In some cases, skin rashes or hives can occur as a reaction to asthma symptoms.
10. Coughing up blood: Rarely, coughing up blood (hemoptysis) can be a sign of more severe asthma attacks.

In rare cases, people with asthma may experience other symptoms, such as:

* Chest pain or discomfort
* Fatigue that interferes with daily activities
* Nausea and vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea

It's essential to note that these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, so if you're experiencing any of them, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

* Epiglottitis (inflammation of the epiglottis, which can cause severe chest pain)

It's essential to note that not all cases of chest pain are caused by one of these conditions, and a proper diagnosis requires a medical evaluation. If you're experiencing persistent or severe chest pain, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly.
```

**Score**: 0.60

**Explanation**: The system answer provides a comprehensive list of potential causes for chest pain, which is a positive aspect. However, it completely misses the specific disease (Hypertension) mentioned in the expected answer. While the system correctly identifies many common causes, the failure to include the single, explicitly stated disease significantly reduces its accuracy. The inclusion of a disclaimer about seeking medical attention is also relevant and appropriate. Therefore, while reasonably informative, the system's failure to include the key element results in a score below 0.9.

#### Expected Answer

```
One disease (Hypertension) has chest pain as a symptom.
```

According to the medical database, regular exercise has been shown to have numerous benefits in preventing various diseases and conditions. Here are some examples:

1. **Heart Disease**: Regular physical activity can help lower blood pressure, improve circulation, and increase overall cardiovascular health, all of which can reduce the risk of heart disease.
2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: Exercise has been proven to improve insulin sensitivity, glucose regulation, and overall metabolic health, making it a key component in preventing and managing type 2 diabetes.
3. **Certain Cancers**: Physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of several types of cancer, including breast, colon, kidney, and esophageal cancer.
4. **Osteoporosis**: Regular exercise, particularly weight-bearing and resistance exercises, can help maintain bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.
5. **Hypertension**: Exercise has been shown to effectively manage and control hypertension, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke.
6. **Stroke**: Physical activity can help lower blood pressure, improve blood vessel function, and increase overall cardiovascular health, all of which can reduce the risk of stroke.
7. **Respiratory Diseases**: Regular exercise can help improve lung function, reduce symptoms of asthma, and prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
8. **Certain Neurological Conditions**: Exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function, reduce the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and manage symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.
9. **Kidney Disease**: Regular physical activity can help reduce the progression of kidney disease and lower blood pressure, both of which can improve overall health and quality of life.
10. **Cognitive Function**: Exercise has been linked to improved cognitive function, including better memory, attention, and processing speed.

It's essential to note that regular exercise should be combined with a healthy diet and lifestyle habits to maximize its benefits. Additionally, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program.
```

**Score**: 0.85

**Explanation**: The system answer is highly relevant and largely correct. It directly addresses the expected answer ("Hypertension can be prevented by regular exercise") by detailing how exercise impacts hypertension (reducing blood pressure, improving circulation, etc.). Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits of exercise across numerous conditions, demonstrating a good level of completeness. The concluding note about combining exercise with a healthy lifestyle and consulting a healthcare professional adds further value. The only minor deduction is for not explicitly stating "hypertension" in the initial response, although it’s implicitly covered within the broader discussion of blood pressure management.

Regular exercise is known to have a wide range of benefits, and some diseases can even be prevented or managed with regular physical activity. Here are some examples:

1. **Heart Disease**: Regular exercise can help lower blood pressure, increase HDL (good) cholesterol, and reduce triglycerides, all of which can contribute to heart disease.
2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: Exercise is a key component of the American Diabetes Association's "Action Plan" for managing type 2 diabetes. Regular physical activity can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.
3. **Obesity**: Regular exercise can help with weight loss and maintenance, reducing the risk of obesity-related health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers.
4. **Certain Types of Cancer**: Exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of colon, breast, prostate, and endometrial cancers. Regular physical activity can also slow the growth and spread of cancer cells.
5. **Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia**: Exercise has been linked to a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and dementia, possibly due to its cognitive-stimulating effects.
6. **Stroke**: Physical activity can help reduce the risk of stroke by improving blood vessel function, lowering blood pressure, and reducing inflammation.
7. **Kidney Disease**: Regular exercise can help slow the progression of kidney disease in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
8. **Sleep Apnea**: Exercise can help improve sleep quality and reduce symptoms of sleep apnea.
9. **Anxiety and Depression**: Physical activity has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.
10. **Certain Neurodegenerative Diseases**: Exercise may help slow the progression of diseases such as Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease.
11. **Pregnancy-Related Complications**: Regular exercise during pregnancy can reduce the risk of gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preeclampsia.
12. **Cognitive Decline**: Exercise has been linked to a reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline and dementia.
13. **Fibromyalgia**: Physical activity can help manage symptoms of fibromyalgia, such as pain and fatigue.
14. **Autoimmune Diseases**: Regular exercise may help reduce the risk of developing autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

Remember to always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have any underlying medical conditions or concerns.
```

**Score**: 0.50

**Explanation**: The system answer provides a very broad overview of the benefits of regular exercise across numerous diseases. While it mentions hypertension (point 6) as a disease that can be impacted by exercise, it doesn't directly answer the expected question, which is "Hypertension can be prevented by regular exercise." The system answer provides context about how exercise *affects* hypertension, but doesn't state the preventative aspect as requested. Therefore, it only partially addresses the expected answer.

#### Expected Answer

```
Hypertension can be prevented by regular exercise.

### Question 36: What symptom is most common in Influenza?

**Entities**: Influenza Disease, Fever Symptom, Cough Treatment, Insulin Therapy Symptom, Pain Relievers Treatment, Vaccination Prevention, Regular Exercise Risk Factor, Smoking Age Group, Obesity Gender

**Query Type**: general

**Query**:
```cypher
MATCH (d:Disease {name: "Influenza Disease"})-[:HAS_SYMPTOM]->(s:Symptom)-[:HAS_TREATMENT]->(t:Treatment)
RETURN s.name AS SymptomName, t.name AS TreatmentName, d.name AS DiseaseName
```

#### With Neo4j

**System Answer**:
```
According to the provided context from a medical database, the most common symptom of Influenza (the flu) is fever. This information is likely based on a study or dataset that tracks the typical symptoms experienced by individuals infected with Influenza.
```

**Score**: 0.65

**Explanation**: The system answer is largely correct in stating that fever is the most common symptom of influenza. However, it lacks the crucial detail about the prevalence – specifically, that it occurs in 90% of cases. This omission significantly reduces the completeness of the answer. While relevant to the question, the absence of quantitative data lowers the score.

#### Without Neo4j

**System Answer**:
```
The most common symptoms of influenza, commonly known as the flu, can vary from person to person and can be quite different. However, based on various studies and data, here are some of the most common symptoms:

1. Fever: A high temperature, usually above 102°F (39°C), is a hallmark symptom of the flu.
2. Chills
3. Cough: A dry or wet cough can occur in people with influenza, although it's more common to experience a productive cough that brings up mucus.
4. Sore throat
5. Runny or stuffy nose
6. Headache
7. Muscle or body aches
8. Fatigue (extreme tiredness)
9. Diarrhea and vomiting (in some cases)

However, it's worth noting that not everyone who contracts influenza will experience all of these symptoms. Some people may only feel tired and have a low-grade fever.

The flu is usually most contagious about 1-2 days before symptoms appear and can last up to 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms.
```

**Score**: 0.75

**Explanation**: The system answer provides a generally accurate and reasonably complete list of common influenza symptoms, aligning with typical medical knowledge. It correctly identifies fever as a key symptom and outlines other common manifestations. However, it crucially lacks the specific prevalence data regarding fever (90%) mentioned in the expected answer. This omission significantly detracts from the completeness of the response. Because the system doesn't include the prevalence data, it doesn't fully meet the criteria of the expected answer, hence the score.

#### Expected Answer

```
According to the prevalence data, fever is the most common symptom in Influenza with a prevalence of 90.
