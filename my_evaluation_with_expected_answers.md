| No. | Question | System Answer | Expected Answer | Score | Explanation |
|-----|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | What are the symptoms of Influenza? | Okay, here’s a breakdown of the symptoms associated with Influenza:<br><br>The most common symptoms of Influenza include fever, cough, and fatigue. | The symptoms of Influenza are fever, cough, and fatigue. | 0.95 | The system answer is highly accurate and complete. It correctly identifies the three most common symptoms of influenza (fever, cough, and fatigue). The phrasing is slightly different from the expected answer, but the core information is identical and accurately presented. Therefore, it receives a near-perfect score. |
| 2 | What treatments are available for Diabetes? | Currently, the primary treatment for Diabetes is Insulin Therapy. This involves using insulin to manage blood sugar levels. <br><br>Do you want me to elaborate on Insulin Therapy or perhaps explore other potential treatment approaches for Diabetes? | Diabetes is treated with insulin therapy. | 0.85 | The system answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately identifies insulin therapy as the primary treatment for diabetes and briefly explains its purpose. It’s missing the succinctness of the expected answer, but the core information is present and accurate. A slight deduction is made for the slightly verbose phrasing. |
| 3 | What prevention methods are available for Asthma? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Asthma can be prevented by avoiding allergens. | 0.10 | The system provided an answer ("I couldn't find any information for your question."), which is technically correct in that it acknowledges a lack of information. However, it fails to provide any relevant information, completely missing the opportunity to address the question about preventing asthma. It receives a very low score because it doesn't fulfill the basic requirement of providing an answer, even a negative one, and doesn't demonstrate any understanding of the topic. |
| 4 | What symptoms are associated with Hypertension? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Hypertension is associated with shortness of breath and chest pain. | 0.00 | The system’s response, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” indicates a complete failure to address the query. The expected answer provides a specific, medically relevant association (hypertension and symptoms). The system provided no information whatsoever, failing on all three criteria (correctness, completeness, and relevance). |
| 5 | Which diseases have Fever as a symptom? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Influenza has fever as a symptom. | 0.10 | The system provided an answer ("I couldn't find any information for your question."), which is technically correct in that it acknowledges a lack of information. However, it completely fails to address the question, which was about the symptom of influenza. It receives a very low score because it doesn't offer any relevant information and demonstrates a failure to understand the query. |
| 6 | What treatments does Migraine have? | Error: {code: Neo.ClientError.Statement.SyntaxError} {message: RETURN can only be used at the end of the query. (line 2, column 1 (offset: 69))<br>"RETURN t.name AS TreatmentName, t.description AS TreatmentDescription"<br> ^} | Migraines are treated with pain relievers. | 0.00 | Query execution failed |
| 7 | How can Influenza be prevented? | The best way to prevent Influenza is through vaccination. Vaccines are available to help protect you from getting the flu. | Influenza can be prevented through vaccination. | 0.95 | The system answer is highly accurate and relevant. It correctly states that vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza and explains the purpose of vaccines. It covers all the key elements of the expected answer. A slight deduction (0.05) is made because it’s a slightly verbose phrasing compared to the more concise expected answer. |
| 8 | List the symptoms of Diabetes. | Error: {code: Neo.ClientError.Statement.SyntaxError} {message: Invalid input 'WHERE': expected 'FOREACH', ',', 'ORDER BY', 'CALL', 'CREATE', 'LOAD CSV', 'DELETE', 'DETACH', 'FINISH', 'INSERT', 'LIMIT', 'MATCH', 'MERGE', 'NODETACH', 'OFFSET', 'OPTIONAL', 'REMOVE', 'RETURN', 'SET', 'SKIP', 'UNION', 'UNWIND', 'USE', 'WITH' or <EOF> (line 3, column 1 (offset: 100))<br>"WHERE d.name = 'Diabetes' OR s.name IN ['blurred vision', 'excessive thirst', 'frequent urination', 'slow-healing sores', 'fatigue']"<br> ^} | Diabetes has symptoms of fatigue and blurred vision. | 0.00 | Query execution failed |
| 9 | Find diseases that have Cough as a symptom. | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Influenza and Asthma have cough as a symptom. | 0.20 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” indicates a failure to provide any relevant information. While technically correct in that it didn’t find *specific* information, it doesn’t fulfill the requirement of providing a factual answer. The expected answer directly addresses the implied question (the relationship between Influenza and Asthma) with a relevant symptom. The system’s response is entirely irrelevant and therefore scores very low. |
| 10 | What prevention methods does Diabetes have? | Okay, let's talk about preventing Diabetes. Based on the information we have, a key prevention method is maintaining a **Healthy Diet**. Focusing on a balanced and nutritious diet is a significant step in reducing your risk. <br><br>Do you want to explore other aspects of diabetes prevention, such as exercise or lifestyle changes? | Diabetes can be prevented with a healthy diet. | 0.85 | The system’s answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately identifies “maintaining a Healthy Diet” as a key prevention method for diabetes. It also provides a brief, supportive explanation. While it doesn’t cover other aspects like exercise or lifestyle changes as requested in the expected answer, it fulfills the core requirement of stating a key preventative measure. Therefore, it receives a high score, reflecting a good response to the question. |
| 11 | What is the treatment for Asthma? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Asthma is treated with bronchodilators. | 0.10 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely irrelevant and provides no useful information. While technically correct in that it didn’t find *any* information, it fails to address the implied question about asthma treatment. A score of 0.1 reflects a minimal acknowledgement of the request, but a complete failure to provide a relevant answer. |
| 12 | Which disease uses Vaccination as prevention? | According to the database, **Influenza** is a disease that utilizes vaccination as a preventative measure. Vaccination is the method used to protect against it. | Influenza uses vaccination as prevention. | 0.85 | The system answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately states that Influenza utilizes vaccination for prevention. While the phrasing is slightly more verbose than the expected answer, it conveys the same core information. There's no factual error, and it directly addresses the question. A slight deduction is made for the slightly less concise wording. |
| 13 | What symptoms does Asthma have? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Asthma has symptoms of shortness of breath and cough. | 0.10 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely unhelpful and doesn’t address the implied question about asthma symptoms. While technically correct in that it didn’t find information, it fails on all other criteria – correctness (it doesn’t provide any information), completeness (it doesn’t offer any relevant details), and relevance (it doesn’t answer the question). A score of 0.1 reflects the minimal value it provides simply because it acknowledges the question was attempted. |
| 14 | How many symptoms are linked to Influenza? | According to the database, Influenza is associated with several symptoms. These include fever, cough, and fatigue. | Influenza has 3 symptoms: fever, cough, and fatigue. | 0.85 | The system answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately identifies the three key symptoms associated with Influenza (fever, cough, and fatigue). The phrasing is slightly verbose ("According to the database, Influenza is associated with several symptoms"), but the core information is presented correctly. Therefore, it receives a high score reflecting its accuracy and direct response to the implied question. |
| 15 | Which diseases show Fatigue as a symptom? | Okay, here’s a breakdown of diseases where fatigue is a symptom, based on the available information:<br><br>**Fatigue** can be a symptom of several conditions. According to the database, it’s associated with:<br><br>*   **Influenza:** Fatigue is a common symptom of the flu.<br>*   **Diabetes:** Fatigue is also frequently reported as a symptom of diabetes.<br><br>Do you want me to elaborate on any of these diseases or perhaps search for other conditions that include fatigue as a symptom? | Influenza and Diabetes show fatigue as a symptom. | 0.95 | The system’s answer is highly accurate and relevant. It correctly identifies Influenza and Diabetes as diseases associated with fatigue, as stated in the expected answer. The response is clear, concise, and offers further options for elaboration or searching, demonstrating a helpful and informative approach. The score is slightly reduced (only 0.95) to account for the minor possibility of a slight nuance in the expected answer's phrasing. |
| 16 | List all diseases with their symptoms. | Here’s a breakdown of diseases and their associated symptoms based on the available data:<br><br>*   **Influenza:** Symptoms include Fever, Cough, and Fatigue.<br>*   **Asthma:** Symptoms include Cough and Shortness of Breath.<br>*   **Diabetes:** Symptoms include Fatigue and Blurred Vision.<br>*   **Migraine:** Symptoms include Headache and Nausea.<br>*   **Hypertension:** Symptoms include Shortness of Breath and Chest Pain.<br><br>Please note that this information is based solely on the provided database results and may not represent a complete list of symptoms or diseases. | Influenza: fever, cough, fatigue. Diabetes: fatigue, blurred vision. Hypertension: shortness of breath, chest pain. Asthma: shortness of breath, cough. Migraine: headache, nausea. | 0.95 | The system answer is highly accurate and complete. It correctly lists the symptoms associated with each disease as provided in the expected answer. The formatting is also consistent and clear. The inclusion of the disclaimer about the data source is a positive addition, demonstrating responsible AI behavior. The only minor deduction is for not using the exact wording from the expected answer, but the core information is perfectly conveyed. |
| 17 | What is the prevention method for Migraine? | Okay, let's talk about migraine prevention. Based on the information available, a key method is **stress management**. Managing stress can be a really important part of preventing migraine attacks. <br><br>Do you want to explore other potential prevention strategies as well? | Migraines can be prevented through stress management. | 0.85 | The system’s answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately identifies “stress management” as a key prevention strategy for migraines. It’s a complete answer to the expected response. The language is also appropriate and helpful. A slight deduction (0.15) is made because it’s a very basic response and doesn’t offer any further elaboration or acknowledge other potential preventative measures, even though the prompt asks if the system wants to explore others. |
| 18 | What treatment is given for Hypertension? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs. | 0.20 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is technically correct in that it acknowledges a lack of information. However, it doesn’t provide any useful information or address the underlying medical question. It receives a low score because it fails to fulfill the basic requirement of providing a relevant answer, even if it correctly identifies a lack of data. It’s a placeholder response and doesn’t demonstrate any understanding of the query. |
| 19 | Find diseases that have Headache as a symptom. | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Migraine has headache as a symptom. | 0.10 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely unhelpful and doesn’t address the question at all. While technically correct in that it didn’t find information, it fails to provide any relevant information. It receives a very low score because it doesn’t demonstrate any understanding or attempt to answer the query, and completely misses the expected factual response about migraine symptoms. |
| 20 | Which disease is linked to Nausea? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Migraine is linked to nausea. | 0.10 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely irrelevant and incorrect. While it acknowledges a lack of information, it doesn't provide any useful information or even attempt to address the implied question (likely about the relationship between migraines and nausea). The expected answer directly states a factual link, and the system fails to do so. Therefore, the score is very low, reflecting a complete failure to address the question. |
| 21 | List the treatments for Hypertension. | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs. | 0.20 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is technically correct in that it acknowledges a lack of information. However, it fails to provide any useful information whatsoever. While it addresses the question of finding information, it doesn't fulfill the core requirement of answering the question itself. The expected answer provides a basic, relevant fact about hypertension treatment. The system’s response receives a very low score due to its complete lack of helpful information. |
| 22 | What prevention methods are used for Influenza? | The primary prevention method for Influenza is vaccination. Getting an annual influenza vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others from the virus. | Influenza prevention includes vaccination. | 0.95 | The system answer is highly accurate and relevant. It correctly identifies vaccination as the primary prevention method for influenza and explicitly states the importance of annual vaccination. It covers all the key elements of the expected answer. A slight deduction (0.05) is made because it’s a slightly verbose response when a more concise answer would be ideal, but the information provided is entirely correct and relevant. |
| 23 | What symptoms are related to Migraine? | Error: {code: Neo.ClientError.Statement.SyntaxError} {message: Invalid input 'WHERE': expected 'FOREACH', ',', 'ORDER BY', 'CALL', 'CREATE', 'LOAD CSV', 'DELETE', 'DETACH', 'FINISH', 'INSERT', 'LIMIT', 'MATCH', 'MERGE', 'NODETACH', 'OFFSET', 'OPTIONAL', 'REMOVE', 'RETURN', 'SET', 'SKIP', 'UNION', 'UNWIND', 'USE', 'WITH' or <EOF> (line 3, column 1 (offset: 100))<br>"WHERE d.name = 'Migraine'"<br> ^} | Migraines are related to headaches and nausea. | 0.00 | Query execution failed |
| 24 | How is Diabetes treated? | Based on the information available, the primary treatment for Diabetes is Insulin Therapy. | Diabetes is treated with insulin therapy. | 0.90 | The system answer is entirely correct and provides the primary treatment for diabetes. It’s phrased slightly differently than the expected answer ("Diabetes is treated with insulin therapy"), but the core information is accurately conveyed. The phrasing is acceptable and doesn’t detract from the factual correctness. Therefore, a score of 0.9 reflects a very high degree of accuracy and relevance. |
| 25 | Which diseases are prevented by a Healthy Diet? | According to the database, a healthy diet can help prevent Influenza. | Diabetes is prevented by a healthy diet. | 0.20 | The system answer correctly states that a healthy diet can help prevent Influenza, which is factually accurate. However, the expected answer specifically mentions *diabetes* prevention. The system answer fails to address the key element of the expected answer – the disease being prevented. Therefore, it receives a low score due to a significant lack of completeness and direct relevance to the expected answer. |
| 26 | List diseases that have Shortness of Breath as a symptom. | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Hypertension and Asthma have shortness of breath as a symptom. | 0.20 | The system’s answer correctly identifies shortness of breath as a symptom, which is a relevant aspect of the expected answer. However, it fails to provide any context or connection to the specific medical conditions mentioned (Hypertension and Asthma). It’s a very basic response and doesn’t demonstrate understanding of the question's intent. Therefore, it receives a low score due to lack of completeness and context. |
| 27 | What are the common symptoms of Asthma? | Based on the information available, common symptoms of Asthma include a cough and shortness of breath. | Asthma has symptoms of shortness of breath and cough. | 0.90 | The system’s answer is entirely correct and accurately lists common symptoms of asthma (cough and shortness of breath). It’s a complete and relevant response to the question. The wording is slightly different, but the core information is identical and accurate. |
| 28 | Which diseases are linked to Cough and Fever? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Influenza is linked to both cough and fever. | 0.10 | The system’s response, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” indicates a failure to provide any answer whatsoever. While technically correct in that it didn’t find information, it doesn’t fulfill the core function of a question answering system. The expected answer provides a specific, relevant fact. The system receives a very low score due to its complete lack of a useful response. |
| 29 | What treatment does Influenza have? | Based on the information available, the primary treatment for Influenza is Antiviral Medication. | Influenza is treated with antiviral medication. | 0.90 | The system answer is highly accurate and directly addresses the question. It correctly identifies antiviral medication as the primary treatment for influenza.

A minor difference in wording doesn't significantly detract from the overall quality of the response. |
| 30 | What prevention is recommended for Hypertension? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Regular exercise is recommended for preventing hypertension. | 0.10 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” indicates a failure to provide an answer. While technically correct in that it didn’t find information, it doesn’t fulfill the core function of a question answering system. The expected answer provides a specific recommendation. The score reflects a very low level of performance as it simply states a lack of information without offering any relevant response. |
| 31 | Which disease has the symptom Dizziness? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | None of the diseases in the database have dizziness as a symptom. | 0.20 | The system’s answer is technically correct in that it states no diseases in the database have dizziness as a symptom. However, it fails to provide any context or explanation, which is a crucial element of a good medical answer. The expected answer offers a more informative response by stating *why* no matches were found. The system’s response is simply a negative result without any supporting information, significantly reducing its usefulness and therefore the score. |
| 32 | List the treatments available for Migraine. | Based on the available information, the primary treatment listed for Migraine is “Pain Relievers.” However, the description of this treatment is currently not provided. <br><br>It’s important to note that this is a limited set of results, and there are many other treatments available for migraine, such as prescription medications, lifestyle adjustments, and alternative therapies. <br><br>Would you like me to explore other potential treatments for migraine, or perhaps provide more details about “Pain Relleivers”? | Migraines are treated with pain relievers. | 0.75 | The system’s answer is largely correct and relevant. It correctly identifies “Pain Relleivers” as a primary treatment for migraine. However, it acknowledges the lack of detail, which is a valid limitation of the current information. It also appropriately suggests other treatments exist. While not perfectly concise like the expected answer, it fulfills the core requirements of the question. |
| 33 | What are the prevention methods for Diabetes? | Okay, let’s talk about preventing diabetes. Based on the information available, a key prevention method is maintaining a **healthy diet**. Focusing on a balanced and nutritious eating plan is a really important step in reducing your risk. <br><br>Do you want to explore other aspects of diabetes prevention, such as exercise or lifestyle changes? | Diabetes can be prevented with a healthy diet. | 0.85 | The system’s answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately identifies a key preventative measure – a healthy diet. While it doesn’t explicitly state “Diabetes can be prevented,” the phrasing “reducing your risk” effectively conveys this. It also proactively offers to explore other aspects, demonstrating a helpful and informative approach. The score is slightly reduced because a more direct statement of prevention would have been ideal, but the response is still very good. |
| 34 | How many diseases have the symptom Chest Pain? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | One disease (Hypertension) has chest pain as a symptom. | 0.20 | The system correctly identifies that *Hypertension* has chest pain as a symptom, fulfilling a key aspect of the expected answer. However, it fails to provide any information at all, making it a very weak response. It doesn't demonstrate relevance beyond simply stating it couldn't find information, and lacks any useful details. The score reflects a minimal acknowledgement of the expected answer's core content. |
| 35 | Which diseases can be prevented by Regular Exercise? | Error: {code: Neo.ClientError.Statement.SyntaxError} {message: Invalid input 'WHERE': expected an expression, 'FOREACH', ',', 'AS', 'ORDER BY', 'CALL', 'CREATE', 'LOAD CSV', 'DELETE', 'DETACH', 'FINISH', 'INSERT', 'LIMIT', 'MATCH', 'MERGE', 'NODETACH', 'OFFSET', 'OPTIONAL', 'REMOVE', 'RETURN', 'SET', 'SKIP', 'UNION', 'UNWIND', 'USE', 'WITH' or <EOF> (line 4, column 1 (offset: 74))<br>"WHERE p.name = "Vaccination""<br> ^} | Hypertension can be prevented by regular exercise. | 0.00 | Query execution failed |
| 36 | What symptom is most common in Influenza? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | According to the prevalence data, fever is the most common symptom in Influenza with a prevalence of 90. | 0.00 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” indicates a complete failure to address the query. The expected answer provides specific, factual information about a symptom (fever) and its prevalence in a disease (Influenza). The system’s response offers no relevant information whatsoever, thus receiving a score of 0.0. |
| 37 | Which diseases have Sweating as a symptom? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | None of the diseases in the database have sweating as a symptom. | 0.20 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is technically correct in that it indicates a lack of information. However, it fails to provide any useful information or context. The expected answer offers a specific negative finding – that no diseases in the database share the symptom of sweating. This lack of a substantive response significantly reduces the score. While relevant, the system’s response is extremely unhelpful. |

```

**Score**: 0.10

**Explanation**: The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely unhelpful and doesn’t address the implied question about asthma symptoms. While technically correct in that it didn’t find information, it fails on all other criteria – correctness (it doesn’t provide any information), completeness (it doesn’t offer any relevant details), and relevance (it doesn’t answer the question). A score of 0.1 reflects the minimal value it provides simply because it acknowledges the question was attempted.

```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Migraines can be prevented through stress management.
```

**Score**: 0.85

**Explanation**: The system’s answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately identifies “stress management” as a key prevention strategy for migraines. It’s a complete answer to the expected response. The language is also appropriate and helpful. A slight deduction (0.15) is made because it’s a very basic response and doesn’t offer any further elaboration or acknowledge other potential preventative measures, even though the prompt asks if the system wants to explore others.

```
I couldn't find any information for your question.
```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Migraine has headache as a symptom.
```

**Score**: 0.10

**Explanation**: The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely unhelpful and doesn’t address the question at all.

```
I couldn't find any information for your question.
```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Migraine is linked to nausea.
```

**Score**: 0.10

**Explanation**: The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely irrelevant and incorrect. While it acknowledges a lack of information, it doesn't provide any useful information or even attempt to address the implied question (likely about the relationship between migraines and nausea).

```
I couldn't find any information for your question.
```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs.
```

**Score**: 0.20

**Explanation**: The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is technically correct in that it acknowledges a lack of information. However, it fails to provide any useful information whatsoever. While it addresses the question of finding information, it doesn't fulfill the core requirement of answering the question itself. The expected answer provides a basic, relevant fact about hypertension treatment. The system’s response receives a very low score due to its complete lack of helpful information.

```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Influenza prevention includes vaccination.
```

**Score**: 0.95

**Explanation**: The system answer is highly accurate and relevant. It correctly identifies vaccination as the primary prevention method for influenza and explicitly states the importance of annual vaccination. It covers all the key elements of the expected answer. A slight deduction (0.05) is made because it’s a slightly verbose response when a more concise answer would be ideal, but the information provided is entirely correct and relevant.

**Query**:
```cypher
MATCH (d:Disease {name: "Migraine"})-[:HAS_TREATMENT]->(t:Treatment)
RETURN t.name AS TreatmentName, t.description AS TreatmentDescription
```

**System Answer**:
```
Based on the available information, the primary treatment listed for Migraine is “Pain Relievers.” However, the description of this treatment is currently not provided. 

It’s important to note that this is a limited set of results, and there are many other treatments available for migraine, such as prescription medications, lifestyle adjustments, and alternative therapies. 

Would you like me to explore other potential treatments for migraine, or perhaps provide more details about “Pain Relleivers”?
```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Migraines are treated with pain relievers.
```

**Score**: 0.75

**Explanation**: The system’s answer is largely correct and relevant. It correctly identifies “Pain Relleivers” as a primary treatment for migraine. However, it acknowledges the lack of detail, which is a valid limitation of the current information. It also appropriately suggests other treatments exist. While not perfectly concise like the expected answer, it fulfills the core requirements of the question.

Do you want to explore other aspects of diabetes prevention, such as exercise or lifestyle changes?
```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Diabetes can be prevented with a healthy diet.
```

**Score**: 0.85

**Explanation**: The system’s answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately identifies a key preventative measure – a healthy diet. While it doesn’t explicitly state “Diabetes can be prevented,” the phrasing “reducing your risk” effectively conveys this. It also proactively offers to explore other aspects, demonstrating a helpful and informative approach. The score is slightly reduced because a more direct statement of prevention would have been ideal, but the response is still very good.

```

**Expected Answer**:
```
According to the prevalence data, fever is the most common symptom in Influenza with a prevalence of 90.
```

**Score**: 0.00

**Explanation**: The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” indicates a complete failure to address the query. The expected answer provides specific, factual information about a symptom (fever) and its prevalence in a disease (Influenza). The system’s response offers no relevant information whatsoever, thus receiving a score of 0.0.
