It correctly identifies Influenza and Asthma as diseases with cough as a symptom. The phrasing is clear and concise, directly addressing the question. The slight deduction (5%) is only for the slightly verbose introductory phrase "Okay, here’s a list of diseases..." which isn't strictly necessary for the core information. |
| 10 | What prevention methods does Diabetes have? | Okay, let's talk about preventing Diabetes. Based on the information available, a **Healthy Diet** is a key prevention method. Maintaining a healthy diet is important in reducing your risk of developing Diabetes. <br><br>Do you want to explore specific dietary recommendations or other prevention strategies for Diabetes? | Diabetes can be prevented with a healthy diet. | 0.85 | The system’s answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately identifies a “Healthy Diet” as a key prevention method for Diabetes. It also provides a brief, understandable explanation. While it could be more comprehensive, it fulfills the core requirements of the expected answer. A slight deduction is made because it doesn’t explicitly state “Diabetes can be prevented” as the expected answer does. |
| 11 | What is the treatment for Asthma? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Asthma is treated with bronchodilators. | 0.10 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely irrelevant and provides no useful information.

| 18 | What treatment is given for Hypertension? | Based on the information available, hypertension is associated with symptoms like shortness of breath and chest pain. However, this data doesn’t specify the treatments for hypertension itself. <br><br>It’s important to consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate treatment options, which typically include lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) and medications. | Hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs. | 0.65 | The system’s answer is partially correct and relevant. It accurately identifies symptoms associated with hypertension and correctly advises consulting a healthcare professional. However, it fails to provide the core, expected answer – the treatment for hypertension itself (antihypertensive drugs). While it mentions lifestyle changes, it doesn’t explicitly state the primary treatment method. Therefore, it’s not fully complete and receives a score reflecting partial correctness and relevance. |
| 19 | Find diseases that have Headache as a symptom. | Based on the database results, headache is a symptom of Migraine. | Migraine has headache as a symptom. | 0.90 | The system’s answer is entirely correct and directly addresses the question. It accurately states that “Migraine has headache as a symptom,” mirroring the expected answer. There's no room for improvement in terms of factual accuracy or relevance. A score of 0.9 reflects a near-perfect response. |
| 20 | Which disease is linked to Nausea? | Based on the information available, nausea is linked to Migraine. | Migraine is linked to nausea. | 0.80 | The system answer is factually correct – nausea is indeed linked to migraines. It covers the core information from the expected answer. The phrasing is slightly different ("nausea is linked to Migraine" vs. "Migraine is linked to nausea"), but the meaning is identical. Therefore, it’s highly relevant and accurate, deserving a high score. |
| 21 | List the treatments for Hypertension. | Based on the information provided, the database currently lists symptoms associated with hypertension, rather than specific treatments. It indicates that shortness of breath and chest pain are symptoms related to hypertension. <br><br>It’s important to note that this list doesn’t include treatments for hypertension. If you are experiencing these symptoms or have been diagnosed with hypertension, it’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss appropriate treatment options, which may include medication, lifestyle changes, and other therapies. | Hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs. | 0.60 | The system answer is partially correct. It accurately identifies that hypertension is associated with symptoms like shortness of breath and chest pain. However, it fails to provide the core, expected answer which is a direct statement about treatment ("Hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs").

Therefore, it receives a moderate score reflecting partial correctness and relevance but lacking completeness. |
| 22 | What prevention methods are used for Influenza? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Influenza prevention includes vaccination. | 0.20 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is technically correct in that it acknowledges a lack of information. However, it completely fails to address the question, which was about influenza prevention. While it doesn’t provide a correct answer, it doesn’t even attempt to do so. A score of 0.2 reflects a minimal acknowledgement of the query, but a significant lack of any relevant response. |
| 23 | What symptoms are related to Migraine? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Migraines are related to headaches and nausea. | 0.10 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely unhelpful and doesn’t address the implied question (likely about migraines and their relationship to headaches and nausea). While technically correct in that it didn’t find information, it fails on all other criteria – correctness (it doesn’t provide an answer), completeness (it doesn’t offer any relevant information), and relevance (it doesn’t relate to the topic). A score of 0.1 reflects the minimal value it provides. |
| 24 | How is Diabetes treated? | Based on the information available, the primary treatment for Diabetes is Insulin Therapy. | Diabetes is treated with insulin therapy. | 0.90 | The system answer is highly accurate and directly addresses the question about the primary treatment for diabetes. It states “Insulin Therapy” which is the correct primary treatment.

It accurately identifies “Pain Relievers” as a primary treatment for migraines. It also correctly notes that this is a simplified overview and that a full treatment plan is more complex. The answer directly addresses the expected answer. The only minor deduction is due to the slightly verbose phrasing ("Pain Relievers" instead of simply "pain relievers"). |
| 33 | What are the prevention methods for Diabetes? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | Diabetes can be prevented with a healthy diet. | 0.10 | The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely unhelpful and doesn’t address the implied question about diabetes prevention. While technically correct in that it didn’t find information, it provides no useful information whatsoever. It receives a very low score because it fails on all three criteria: it’s factually correct in that it didn’t find anything, but completely irrelevant and incomplete. |
| 34 | How many diseases have the symptom Chest Pain? | Based on the database results, chest pain is a symptom associated with Hypertension. | One disease (Hypertension) has chest pain as a symptom. | 0.80 | The system’s answer is factually correct – hypertension is indeed associated with chest pain. It covers the core aspect of the expected answer by stating that “one disease (Hypertension) has chest pain as a symptom.” The answer is relevant to the question and provides a concise, accurate response. A slight deduction (0.2) is made because it could be slightly more concise, but the information is presented correctly. |

Additionally, it’s noted that healthy diet and vaccination can help prevent influenza. | Hypertension can be prevented by regular exercise. | 0.80 | The system answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately states that regular exercise can prevent hypertension, which is the core of the expected answer. The inclusion of information about influenza prevention is a bonus and demonstrates broader knowledge, though not explicitly requested. Therefore, it’s a very good response. |
| 36 | What symptom is most common in Influenza? | According to the database, the most common symptom associated with Influenza is fever. Other frequently experienced symptoms include cough and fatigue. | According to the prevalence data, fever is the most common symptom in Influenza with a prevalence of 90. | 0.75 | The system answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately identifies fever as the most common symptom of influenza and mentions cough and fatigue, which are also frequently associated. However, it lacks the crucial detail about the *prevalence* of fever (90%), which is a key element of the expected answer. While the system correctly identifies the symptom, it doesn't provide the quantitative data that strengthens the answer. Therefore, it’s a good response but not a perfect one. |
| 37 | Which diseases have Sweating as a symptom? | I couldn't find any information for your question. | None of the diseases in the database have sweating as a symptom. | 0.20 | The system’s answer is technically correct in that it states there’s no information found. However, it fails to provide the *type* of information expected – a statement about the absence of sweating as a symptom across the database. It doesn’t offer any helpful context or a reasoned explanation. Therefore, it receives a low score as it doesn’t fulfill the requirements of a useful medical answer. |

```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs.
```

**Score**: 0.65

**Explanation**: The system’s answer is partially correct and relevant. It accurately identifies symptoms associated with hypertension and correctly advises consulting a healthcare professional. However, it fails to provide the core, expected answer – the treatment for hypertension itself (antihypertensive drugs). While it mentions lifestyle changes, it doesn’t explicitly state the primary treatment method. Therefore, it’s not fully complete and receives a score reflecting partial correctness and relevance.

```

**System Answer**:
```
Based on the information available, nausea is linked to Migraine.
```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Migraine is linked to nausea.
```

**Score**: 0.80

**Explanation**: The system answer is factually correct – nausea is indeed linked to migraines. It covers the core information from the expected answer. The phrasing is slightly different ("nausea is linked to Migraine" vs. "Migraine is linked to nausea"), but the meaning is identical. Therefore, it’s highly relevant and accurate, deserving a high score.

---

### Question 21: List the treatments for Hypertension.

**Entities**: hypertension

**Query Type**: treatments

**Query**:
```cypher
MATCH (d:Disease)-[r:HAS_SYMPTOM]->(s:Symptom) WHERE toLower(d.name) = toLower("hypertension") RETURN s.name AS SymptomName, r.name AS RelationshipName, d.name AS DiseaseName
```

**System Answer**:
```
Based on the information provided, the database currently lists symptoms associated with hypertension, rather than specific treatments. It indicates that shortness of breath and chest pain are symptoms related to hypertension. 

It’s important to note that this list doesn’t include treatments for hypertension. If you are experiencing these symptoms or have been diagnosed with hypertension, it’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss appropriate treatment options, which may include medication, lifestyle changes, and other therapies.
```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs.
```

**Score**: 0.60

**Explanation**: The system answer is partially correct. It accurately identifies that hypertension is associated with symptoms like shortness of breath and chest pain. However, it fails to provide the core, expected answer which is a direct statement about treatment ("Hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs"). While the disclaimer about consulting a healthcare professional is important and relevant, it doesn't fulfill the specific request for a concise treatment answer. Therefore, it receives a moderate score reflecting partial correctness and relevance but lacking completeness.

---

### Question 22: What prevention methods are used for Influenza?

**Entities**: Influenza, Vaccination

**Query Type**: prevention

**Query**:

```

**System Answer**:
```
I couldn't find any information for your question.
```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Influenza prevention includes vaccination.
```

**Score**: 0.20

**Explanation**: The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is technically correct in that it acknowledges a lack of information. However, it completely fails to address the question, which was about influenza prevention. While it doesn’t provide a correct answer, it doesn’t even attempt to do so. A score of 0.2 reflects a minimal acknowledgement of the query, but a significant lack of any relevant response.

---

### Question 23: What symptoms are related to Migraine?

**System Answer**:
```
I couldn't find any information for your question.
```

**Expected Answer**:
```
Migraines are related to headaches and nausea.
```

**Score**: 0.10

**Explanation**: The system’s answer, “I couldn’t find any information for your question,” is entirely unhelpful and doesn’t address the implied question (likely about migraines and their relationship to headaches and nausea). While technically correct in that it didn’t find information, it fails on all other criteria – correctness (it doesn’t provide an answer), completeness (it doesn’t offer any relevant information), and relevance (it doesn’t relate to the topic). A score of 0.1 reflects the minimal value it provides.

```

**Score**: 0.75

**Explanation**: The system answer is largely correct and relevant. It accurately identifies fever as the most common symptom of influenza and mentions cough and fatigue, which are also frequently associated. However, it lacks the crucial detail about the *prevalence* of fever (90%), which is a key element of the expected answer. While the system correctly identifies the symptom, it doesn't provide the quantitative data that strengthens the answer. Therefore, it’s a good response but not a perfect one.

---

**System Answer**:
```
I couldn't find any information for your question.
```

**Expected Answer**:
```
None of the diseases in the database have sweating as a symptom.
